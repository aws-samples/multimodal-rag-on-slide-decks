Based on the context provided, the 'combined' index was selected more frequently as it often provided the most comprehensive and relevant information to answer the questions. The 'combined' index seemed to combine details from both text and image sources, allowing it to cover various aspects of the questions more completely.

For example, when asked about the phases of a machine learning lifecycle or the steps involved in operationalizing AI/ML workloads, the 'combined' index provided detailed and accurate responses by leveraging information from both text and images. This made it the best match compared to the 'text_only' or 'img_only' indices, which had incomplete or missing information.

Similarly, for questions about model interpretability or the benefits of machine learning, the 'combined' index gave more insightful explanations by drawing from multiple sources of information.

The 'img_only' index was occasionally selected when the question was specifically about visual information, such as the trade-offs between performance and model interpretability shown in a graph. However, for most questions requiring textual explanations, the 'img_only' index fell short.

The 'text_only' index was rarely the best match, as it often lacked sufficient context or details to fully answer the questions.

Overall, the 'combined' index's ability to leverage both textual and visual information made it a more robust and comprehensive source for answering a wide range of questions related to machine learning concepts and processes.
