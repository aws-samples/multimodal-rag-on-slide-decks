Based on the context provided, the 'combined' response source (which combines information from both text and image indexes) was selected as the best match most frequently across the given questions. This is likely because the combined source leverages multimodal information, allowing it to provide more comprehensive and relevant answers by utilizing complementary information from both text and images.

For example, in the question 'What are the phases of a machine learning lifecycle?', the combined response covered all the key phases accurately by combining information from text and images. Similarly, for 'What are the differences between SageMaker Ground Truth and Data Wrangler?', the combined response clearly explained the distinctions by utilizing information from both modalities.

The 'text_only' source was often deemed insufficient or lacking relevant information to fully answer the questions. In contrast, the 'img_only' source, while sometimes providing partial information, frequently missed important details or context present in the text data.

Therefore, for this specific dataset involving questions related to machine learning concepts and AWS services, the combined multimodal approach seems to be the most effective in providing accurate and comprehensive responses by leveraging the strengths of both text and visual information sources.
