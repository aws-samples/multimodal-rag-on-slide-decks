Based on the context provided, the 'combined' index was selected more frequently as the best match for answering the questions compared to the other indices ('text_only' and 'img_only'). This is because the 'combined' index typically provided the most comprehensive and relevant information by combining both text and image data.

For example, when asked about the phases of a machine learning lifecycle or the trade-offs between model interpretability and performance, the 'combined' index gave detailed explanations supported by relevant images, making it the best match for those questions.

The 'img_only' index was occasionally selected when the question was specifically about interpreting or understanding an image, such as the trade-off graph between model interpretability and performance. However, for most questions, the image alone was not sufficient, and the 'combined' index provided better context by supplementing the image with explanatory text.

The 'text_only' index was rarely selected as the best match, as it often lacked the necessary visual aids or comprehensive information present in the 'combined' index responses.

Overall, the 'combined' index strategy seems to be recommended for this dataset as it leverages both textual and visual data, providing more complete and well-rounded responses to the questions. The ability to combine different data modalities (text and images) appears to be advantageous in this context, as it allows for a more holistic understanding and better alignment with the target responses.
