      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m This section discusses Intel's plans for investments and expansion. It mentions that Intel plans to invest more than $30 billion to build two chip-making sites in Magdeburg, Germany. In the U.S., Intel plans to invest up to $100 billion in coming decades to build a huge complex in Ohio. The company recently applied for CHIPS funding for its ion-scale fab expansion in Arizona. The Ohio and Arizona sites are mainly shells that will be 'loaded' with fabrication equipment when the demand environment improved.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m Earnings & Growth Analysis:\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m This section provides financial details. Intel's reported revenue for 2023 was $15.4 billion, which was up 10% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. With the disposal of NVM to SK Hynix in January 2022, GAAP and non-GAAP revenue are identical for all periods. Intel topped the $15.2 billion consensus revenue estimate and came in above the $15.1 billion midpoint of management's $14.6-$15.6 billion guidance range.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m The non-GAAP gross margin was 48.8% in 4Q23, versus 46.0% in 3Q23 and 43.8% a year earlier. The non-GAAP operating margin was 16.7% in 4Q23, versus 14.5% in 3Q23 and 4.3% a year earlier.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m Non-GAAP profit for 4Q23 was $0.54 per diluted share, up from $0.10 a year earlier and $0.41 in 3Q23. Management forecast $0.44 per diluted share for 4Q23, excluding midpoints, and the consensus forecast called for a gain of $0.45.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m For all of 2023, revenue of $54.2 billion declined 14% from $63.1 billion for 2022. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 per diluted share for 2023 was down 44% from $1.85 for 2022.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m For FY23, Intel projects revenue of $12.8-$13.2 billion, which at the $12.7 billion midpoint would be up 9% from the prior year. It projects a non-GAAP gross margin of 44.5% and a non-GAAP profit of $0.13 per diluted share at the guidance midpoints. In the year-earlier quarter, Intel posted a non-GAAP loss of $0.04 per share.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5186)\u001b[0m Given the slow start to the year, as well as higher operating spending on new initiatives, we are lowering our 2024 projection to $41.7 from $1.77. We are implementing a non-GAAP EPS projection of $2.62 per diluted share for 2025. We regard our estimates as fluid and subject to revision based on the timing of recovery in the PC and server markets. Our long-term EPS growth rate estimate is 9%.\n",

      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 1. The Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) revenue increased 313% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. This group was formerly called Internet of Things. For 4Q23, DCAI revenue of $4.0 billion (26% of total) declined 7% annually while rising 5% sequentially. It posted an operating profit of $78 million, down from $371 million a year earlier and up sequentially from $71 million in 3Q23.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 2. Whereas CCG (Client Computing Group) may be on the cusp of recovery or at least near the bottom, DCAI may have several more challenging quarters ahead. For the near term, slower-than-expected DCAI recovery in China and across enterprise broadly has delayed the return of CPU DCAI growth.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 3. Intel lost significant market share in data center CPUs over the past three years to AMD's EPYC processors along with ARM-based solutions such as Graviton's chips that displaced Intel at Amazon AWS. The company expects its 20A and 18A processors will enable it to reclaim transactor leadership and recapture market share in data center in coming years.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 4. Network and edge (10% of total revenue) posted 4Q23 revenue of $1.37 billion, down 29% annually though up slightly on a sequential basis. This business grew in low double-digits in 2022, but declined sharply in 2023 as customers worked through inventory levels. In 4Q23, the unit posted an operating loss of $12 million, after generating $58 million in profit a year earlier.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 5. The emerging business segments, collectively 7% of revenue, include Mobileye (up 13%); Intel conducted the Mobileye IPO in October 2022. Intel Foundry Services (2% of revenue) was down 9%; deliveries 300% growth in 3Q23. Other 4.6% of sales was up five-fold year-over-year.\n",
      "\u001b[36m(async_process_image_data pid=5187)\u001b[0m 6. Standalone operations for the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) are expected to begin in the first quarter in 2024. This split gives PSG the flexibility to accelerate growth and drive value creation in the FPGA industry.\n",

In this case, we will extract the entities of an image description (including the file name to be precise), then extract the entities of the question being asked, to get the most accurate response possible."
