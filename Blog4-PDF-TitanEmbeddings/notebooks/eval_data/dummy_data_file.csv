What are the benefits of Machine learning?,"Machine learning helps with continually learning  from real-world data, and its capability to improve its performance"
What are the Trade-offs between performance and model interpretability graph?,"linear regression and decision trees have higher interpretability but lower accuracy, neural nets have higher accuracy but lower interpretability"
"In Operationalizing AI/ML workloads, what comes under 'Prepare for production'?","Develop infra/resources, quality assurance/testing, containerization, CI/CD"
How can customers encrypt the data for security?,AWS KMS
What are the phases of a machine learning lifecycle?,"Define a scope, prepare data, model development, model deployment, and model monitoring/maintainance."
What are the differences between SageMaker Ground Truth and Data Wrangler?,Ground truth is used for data labeling and data wrangler simplifies the process of data preparation and feature engineering.
What is model interpretability?,"Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. The
higher the interpretability of an ML model, the easier it is to comprehend the model’s predictions."
"For model monitoring, after an ML model has been deployed to a product environment, what is it important to monitor the model based on?",Infrastructure and Performance
"In Operationalizing AI/ML workloads, what comes under 'Development'?","Data extraction, data cleaning/preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation and human in the loop/model review and approval"
What are the steps in the Training pipeline?,"train model, use AWS Glue, Use Amazon SageMaker to train the ensemble models, Training results Queue, and then use the Endpoint update handler."
