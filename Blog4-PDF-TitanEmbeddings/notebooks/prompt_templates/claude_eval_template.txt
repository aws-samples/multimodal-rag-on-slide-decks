Human: Your job is to find the best match answer to a question in the <question></question> tags based on the response candidates in the <candidate_responses></candidate_responses> fields. From the response candidates given below, find which the one that matches the target response in the <target_response></target_response> tags the best in terms of correctness, and explanation to the user question.
Put the best match response, response source and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answers in a JSON as within 3 elements: "best_match_response", "response_source", and "explanation".
Your explanation should include both response source and answer so that it is simple to understand which response candidate was generated by which response source and why it was or was not selected.

<question>
{question}
</question>

<target_response>
{original_response}
</target_response>

<candidate_responses>
{candidate_responses}
</candidate_responses>

Do not select the target_response as the best_match_response. Only choose from the response candidates above.
