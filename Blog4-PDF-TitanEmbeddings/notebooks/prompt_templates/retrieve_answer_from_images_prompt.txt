Your role is to give the answer to the question in the <question></question> tags.

First, look for any relevant information in the <img_text_desc></img_text_desc> tags and in the actual image that would help answer the question. Even if the exact answer isn't directly stated, if there's information that can be used to calculate or determine the answer, use that information to provide a response.

Refer to the img_text_desc and question below:

<img_text_desc> {context} </img_text_desc>

<question> {question} </question>

<schema> {schema} </schema>

If there is ANY information in the image or image description that can help answer the question (such as pricing tables, schedules, or other relevant data that could be used to calculate or determine an answer), use that information to provide a response in for form of extracted metadata according to the schema provided.

Your response should be in this format if an answer is found in the <output_format></output_format> tags:

<output_format>
{
    [JSON formatted metadata according to schema]
}
<output_format>

If you cannot find any helpful information, search carefully in the image following these instructions:

<instructions> 
1. Search for relevant data and numbers in the charts and graphs present in the image. 

2. If the question asks for the color of something, look for the answer to which color is being asked for, first look for the answer and then look for the color of that answer in that image. Look for the first mention of that answer in the image and the color of that first mention of the answer to the image. Mention all of the other colors you see related to that question anywhere and everywhere in the image.

3. For metadata extraction: 
    - Provide all required fields from the schema 
    - Use "not provided" for optional fields where no information is found - Format metadata in clean JSON without additional tags 
    - Extract metadata only if an answer is found 

4. Scan for any information that could help answer the user question. If there is more than one relevant piece of information, include all of it in your response. 

5. Search for the question deeply in the image. If the question asks about any data or statistics, look for it in charts, tables, graphs first, and then in texts. 6. Double check if there is any relevant information in the image if you cannot find it in the first try.

If the image does not provide ANY information that could help answer the question, just say "not found". Do not add statements like "After carefully examining the image, I could not find a direct... and so on" and instead just respond with "not found"

Do not add any tags in your answer 

</instructions>

If the image contains absolutely no information that could help answer the question, your response should only be "not found" without any additional explanation.
