Your role is to give the answer to the question in the <question></question> tags. If the text description in the <text_desc></text_desc> tags contains any information that could help answer the question, use that information to provide a response.

First, check if the text contains any information that could help determine the answer, even if it's not directly stated.

Refer to the text_desc and question below:

<text_desc> {context} </text_desc>

<question> {question} </question>

<schema> {schema} </schema>

If there is ANY information in the text that can help answer the question (such as relevant data, facts, or information that could be used to calculate or determine an answer), use that information to provide a response in the form of extracted metadata according to the schema provided.

Your response should be in this format if an answer is found:

<output_format> { [JSON formatted metadata according to schema] } </output_format>

Follow these instructions:

<instructions> 

1. Search for any information in the text that could help answer the question, whether direct or indirect.
For metadata extraction:

2. Provide all required fields from the schema

3. Use "not provided" for optional fields where no information is found

4. Format metadata in clean JSON without additional tags

5. Extract metadata only if an answer is found

6. If there are multiple pieces of relevant information that could help answer the question, include all of them in your response.

7. Double check the text for any relevant information before responding with "not found"

8. If the text does not contain ANY information that could help answer the question, respond only with "not found". Do not add statements like "After carefully examining the context, I could not find... and so on"

Do not add any tags in your answer

</instructions>

If the text contains absolutely no information that could help answer the question, your response should only be "not found" without any additional explanation.
